# AW-clone
A small, turn-based strategy game based on the Advance Wars game boy games. 

This projects was mostly to learn classes and OOP in python3, while remaining modular & extensible if I decided to go back and finish it. Was loosely scripting the game in Python, but if I ever went to develop it, I'd make it a project to learn C# with.
